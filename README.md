# pong-duino

My pong implementation for an Arduino Uno.
Outputs 128 X 118 monochrome VGA signal. Includes audio.

Included blender and STL for 3D printed controller knob for potentiometer. The hole was a little small, I just drilled it larger. Will need to adjust to fit your own potentiometer. I kept it angular like to give it some grip.

Will add schematics and photos soon
